# Music-Genre-Classification-using-Transformers
In our research, we fine-tuned the DistilHuBERT model using the GTZAN dataset for music genre classification. We evaluated the effectiveness of three different data augmentation techniques.

**Introduction:**
This repository contains code for a music genre classification project using machine learning techniques. The project aims to classify audio clips into various music genres, providing a valuable tool for music enthusiasts, streaming platforms, and researchers.

**Project Structure:**
- `data/`: This directory contains the GTZAN dataset, which comprises audio clips from ten different music genres.
- `models/`: This directory contains pre-trained models and fine-tuned models used for audio classification.
- `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization.
- `train.py`: This script is used to train and fine-tune the classification model on the GTZAN dataset.
- `evaluate.py`: This script is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on a separate test set.
- `predict.py`: This script allows users to classify audio files using a trained model.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the GTZAN dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Train the classification model using the `train.py` script.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using the `evaluate.py` script.
6. Use the `predict.py` script to classify audio files.

**Usage:**
- `train.py`: Run `python train.py` to train the classification model. Adjust the training parameters as needed in the script.
- `evaluate.py`: Run `python evaluate.py` to evaluate the trained model on the test set.
- `predict.py`: Run `python predict.py <audio-file>` to classify a single audio file using the trained model.
